Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Rochester.

To this end, my research draws ideas from vision+graphics, robotics, and computational cognitive science.\nTo master/undergraduate students: If you would like to chat about life, career, or AI/ML research, feel free to email me.

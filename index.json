At the beginning, I was fortunate to work with Thomas Serre on cancer detection, starting as a high school researcher at Brown University.\nI am broadly interested in robot learning, computer vision, and (differentiable) physics simulation. The goal of my research is to allow autonomous agents to learn to acquire physics-informed representation of our world through interactions. To this end, I currently develop methods for robots to learn to interact with deformable objects, such as plasticine and cloth, with challenging physical dynamics.\n Email: sli96@u.rochester.edu, sizheli@mit.edu\nNews: [10/17] Excited to be one of four students nominated by the University of Rochester for CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Awards in North America!\n","date":1666137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1666137600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a visiting student at MIT working on robot learning, hosted by Chuang Gan and Josh Tenenbaum.\nI am also a final-year undergraduate in computer science at the University of Rochester, where I was fortunate to be advised by Chenliang Xu on audio-visual learning.","tags":null,"title":"Sizhe Lester Li","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Sizhe Lester Li","Zhiao Huang","Tao Chen","Tao Du","Hao Su","Joshua B.
